Use dep_data_file.cdl to generate the netcdf file for inputting Henry's Law coefficients
and molectular weights to CESM for use in deposition. This file must be updated every time
a new wet or dry deposited species is added to GEOS-Chem. Once created, the netcdf file
should be renamed to include GEOS-Chem version number and data created, and then copied
to the location set in cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml.

Instructions to using ncgen:
ncgen x.cdl          # checks syntax
ncgen -b x.cdl       # writes x.nc
ncgen -o y.nc x.cdl  # writes y.nc

Notes:
- Added OX since shr_drydep_mod maps dry deposited species O3 to OX in the deposition file.
  Parameters for OX are the same as O3.
